# Business Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a separate dashboard for business users, distinct from the existing parent dashboard. Business users will be automatically redirected to their specialized dashboard upon login.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Business Dashboard UI (`frontend/src/pages/Business/BusinessDashboard.tsx`)
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Activities running today, parents registered, payments collected, refunds/credits issued
- **Upcoming Activities**: List of upcoming activities with venue, time, and action buttons
- **Finance Glimpse**: Visual bar chart showing weekly income with CSS-based charts
- **Recent Notifications**: List of recent notifications with read/unread status
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout matching the provided UI sample

### 2. Backend API (`backend/src/routes/businessDashboard.ts`)
- **GET /api/v1/dashboard/business**: Endpoint for business dashboard data
- **Role-based Access**: Only business users can access this endpoint
- **Comprehensive Data**: Returns stats, upcoming activities, finance data, and notifications
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses Prisma queries with proper indexing

### 3. Routing System (`frontend/src/components/DashboardRouter.tsx`)
- **Automatic Redirection**: Users are redirected based on their role
- **Business Users**: Redirected to `/business/dashboard`
- **Parent/Staff/Admin Users**: Redirected to `/parent/dashboard`
- **Loading State**: Shows loading spinner during redirection

### 4. Updated App Routing (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- **Role-based Routes**: Separate routes for business and parent dashboards
- **Protected Routes**: All dashboard routes require authentication
- **Flexible Routing**: Supports both specific and general dashboard access
