- **Data Integrity**: Maintains existing data while adding new functionality

## User Experience Flow

### **Step 1: Account Type Selection**
1. User visits `/register`
2. Sees two options: Parent and Business
3. Clicks on desired option
4. Navigates to appropriate registration form

### **Step 2: Registration Form**
**For Parents:**
- First Name, Surname, Contact Number, Email, Password
- Standard validation and error handling

**For Businesses:**
- Business Name (required), First Name, Surname, Contact Number, Email, Password
- Enhanced validation including business name requirement

### **Step 3: Account Creation**
- Form submission creates account with appropriate role
- Redirects to login page with success message
- User can then log in with their credentials

## Database Schema Changes

### **Users Table**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN business_name VARCHAR(255) NULL;
```

### **User Model (Prisma)**
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  businessName  String?
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

## Validation Rules

### **Parent Registration**
- First Name: Required, min 2 characters
- Surname: Required, min 2 characters  
- Contact Number: Required
- Email: Required, valid email format
- Password: Required, min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char

### **Business Registration**
- Business Name: Required, min 2 characters
- First Name: Required, min 2 characters
- Surname: Required, min 2 characters
- Contact Number: Required
- Email: Required, valid email format
- Password: Required, min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char

## API Endpoints

### **POST /api/auth/register**
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "role": "business", // or "parent"
  "businessName": "ABC Company" // required for business
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully. Please check your email for verification.",
  "data": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "business",
    "businessName": "ABC Company"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All fields validated on both frontend and backend
- **Role Validation**: Role must be either 'parent' or 'business'
- **Business Name**: Required for business accounts, optional for parents
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements maintained
- **Email Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate accounts

## Mobile Responsiveness

- **Selection Cards**: Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop)
- **Form Layout**: Responsive form with proper spacing and sizing
- **Navigation**: Mobile-friendly back buttons and headers
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriate button sizes for mobile interaction

## Testing Recommendations

### **Parent Registration**
1. Test standard parent registration flow
2. Verify all validation works correctly
3. Confirm account creation with 'parent' role

### **Business Registration**
1. Test business registration with business name
2. Test validation when business name is missing
3. Confirm account creation with 'business' role and business name

### **Edge Cases**
1. Test form validation errors
2. Test duplicate email registration
3. Test navigation between selection and forms
4. Test mobile responsiveness

## Future Enhancements

- **Email Verification**: Send different verification emails for parent vs business
- **Onboarding**: Different onboarding flows for each account type
- **Dashboard**: Role-specific dashboards after login
- **Business Features**: Additional business-specific fields (address, website, etc.)

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/pages/Auth/RegisterPage.tsx` - Complete rewrite
